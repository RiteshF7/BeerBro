## Authentication

The admin console uses Firebase Auth with email-based access control:

- Authentication is handled client-side in the admin layout
- Automatic redirect to home page for unauthorized users

## Firebase Integration

### Firestore Collections
- `products`: Product inventory
- `orders`: Customer orders
- `locations`: Service locations
- `users`: User accounts

### Firebase Storage
- Product images stored in `products/` folder
- Automatic image cleanup on product deletion

## Getting Started

1. Set up Firebase project and configure environment variables
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Run development server: `npm run dev`
4. Access admin console at `/admin`

## Environment Variables

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_api_key
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_project.firebaseapp.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_project.appspot.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_sender_id
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_app_id
```

## Admin Access

To grant admin access, add email addresses to the `ADMIN_EMAILS` array in `src/lib/auth.ts`:

```typescript
const ADMIN_EMAILS = [
  'admin@beerbro.com',
  'your-email@example.com',
];
```

## API Routes

The admin console includes API routes for each feature:
- `/api/admin/products` - Product management
- `/api/admin/orders` - Order management
- `/api/admin/locations` - Location management
- `/api/admin/users` - User management

## Styling

The application uses:
- Tailwind CSS for styling

- Custom color constants for theming
- Responsive design patterns

## Best Practices

- Modular feature-based architecture
- Type-safe with TypeScript and Zod validation
- Consistent error handling and user feedback
- Loading states and optimistic updates
- Clean separation of concerns
